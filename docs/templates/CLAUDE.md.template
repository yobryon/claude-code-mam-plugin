## Project Overview

[Brief description of what this project is and what it does]

## Project Patterns

### Build & Runtime

<!-- Examples:
- Use `bun` instead of `npm` for all JavaScript/TypeScript package management
- Use `uv` for Python package management
- If the UI runs in a container, don't run `bun run dev` locally - rebuild and restart the container
-->

### Code Conventions

<!-- Examples:
- All new code should have unit tests
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
-->

### Architecture Notes

<!-- Examples:
- API endpoints in `src/api/`
- Shared types in `src/types/`
- Database access through repository pattern
-->

### Testing

<!-- Examples:
- Use vitest for unit tests
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Run tests with `bun test`
-->
